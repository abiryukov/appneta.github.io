If you have a question or think you are experiencing a bug, 
submit them [here](https://github.com/appneta/tcpreplay/issues). It is important
that you provide enough information for us to help you.

If your problem has to do with COMPILING tcpreplay:
* Version of tcpreplay you are trying to compile
* Platform (Red Hat Linux 9 on x86, Solaris 7 on SPARC, OS X on PPC, etc)
* Contents of config.status
* Output from **configure** and **make**
* Any additional information you think that would be useful.

If your problem has to do with RUNNING tcpreplay or one of the sub-tools:
* Version information (output of -V)
* Command line used (options and arguments)
* Platform (Red Hat Linux 9 on Intel, Solaris 7 on SPARC, etc)
* Make & model of the network card(s) and driver(s) version
* Error message (if available) and/or description of problem
* If possible, attach the pcap file used (compressed with bzip2 or gzip preferred)
* The core dump or backtrace if available
* Detailed description of your problem or what you are trying to accomplish

Note: The maintainers of tcpreplay primarily uses OS X and Linux; hence, if you're reporting
an issue on another platform, it is important that you give very detailed
information as I may not be able to reproduce your issue.

You are also strongly encouraged to read the extensive documentation (man
pages, FAQ, documents in /docs and email list archives) BEFORE posting to the
tcpreplay-users email list:

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tcpreplay-users

Lastly, please don't email the maintainers directly with your questions.  Doing so
prevents others from potentially helping you and your question/answer from
showing up in the list archives.
